# Introduction

Attendance-calendar, a web-app project. You can use an app-build tool just like Cordova to disguise the dist (gotten by building this project) as an app. And then, you can persist in doing something you want and punch for it on this app everyday. So do that you can preview your punched log by a calendar.
